# timer pulse

Uses a linux timer to create pulses on a GPIO pin.

Needs to be enhanced to take the GPIO pin number and frequency from an argument list.

Other TBD enhancements:
 * boost priority and nice levels to better ensure performance
 * add argument for frequency of a skipped pulse
 * add argument for frequency of an extra pulse
